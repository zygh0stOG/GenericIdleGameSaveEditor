# Generic Idle Game Save Editor

More or less what it says, it will let you edit the save from most games that export saves as a base64 encoded string. Supports LZ and GZip compression as well.

It utilizes the [JSON Tree View](https://github.com/zygh0stOG/json-tree-view) JavaScript module to render JSON and allow easy editing. Also makes use of [Pako](https://linkgoeshere) for GZip and [LZString](https://linkgoeshere).

Tested on [Evolve](https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/), [Idle Dyson Swarm](https://linkgoeshere) and [Magic Research](https://linkgoeshere).
