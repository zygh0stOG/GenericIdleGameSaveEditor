# Generic Idle Game Save Editor

More or less what it says, it will let you edit the save from any game that allows exporting to a base64 encoded and/or LZ compressed string.

It utilizes the [JSON Tree View](https://github.com/zygh0stOG/json-tree-view) JavaScript module to render JSON and allow easy editing. Tested on [Evolve](https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/).
